# Varasto_Solutions

This is a group school project that uses 2 leJOS robots to fill and deliver items from warehouse shelves.
Each robot has a separate GUI that lets the user assign tasks to the robots and view the warehouse inventory status.
The GUI's were built with JavaFX.

The warehouse inventory is stored digitally in a database which is automatically updated during runtime.
